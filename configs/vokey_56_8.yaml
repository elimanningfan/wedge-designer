    grooves:
      spacing: 3.81            # mm - USGA maximum (cannot exceed)

  # Weight & Balance
  weight:
    target_head_weight: 292    # grams - final head weight

  # Material Specifications
  material:
    type: "8620 carbon steel"
    density: 7.85              # g/cm³ - for weight calculations
    
    heat_treatment:
      face_hardness: "50-52 HRC"     # Rockwell hardness for face
      body_hardness: "30-35 HRC"     # Softer body for feel

  # Manufacturing Notes
  manufacturing:
    tolerances:
      hosel_bore: 0.025        # mm - critical tolerance (±0.001")
      loft_lie: 0.5            # degrees - angle tolerance
      sole_width: 0.3          # mm - sole dimension tolerance
      overall_weight: 5        # grams - weight tolerance
    
    critical_notes:
      - "Hosel bore must be exactly 9.4mm (0.370\") for standard shaft"
      - "Heat treat face to 50-52 HRC after machining"
      - "Leading edge radius is subtle - verify with sample"
      - "Grooves must comply with USGA spacing (3.81mm max)"
      - "Inspect sole relief curves for smooth transitions"

# Grind Profile Notes
# This is a versatile "F" or "M" style grind:
# - Full sole width at center (21mm) for stability
# - Moderate heel/toe relief for workability
# - 8° bounce is middle-of-the-road (not high, not low)
# - Works from tight lies, bunkers, and rough
# 
# Compare to other grinds:
# - S Grind: More heel relief, narrower sole (for diggers)
# - K Grind: Wide sole, more bounce (for bunkers)
# - L Grind: Low bounce, minimal relief (for sweepers)
